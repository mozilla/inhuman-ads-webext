Inhuman Ads Web Extension
---

Inhuman Ads is a project to collect screenshots of the worst advertising on the Web and create a "Hall of Shame".

This addon modified Firefox Screenshots to add a button so you could upload screenshots directly to to the Inhuman Ads site.

It was developed by Dan Mills in 2017 and soft launched but scrapped before a hard launch. In 2020 the infrastructure was retired and in 2021 the addon was updated to remove any meaningful functionality. This README was added as part of that update.
